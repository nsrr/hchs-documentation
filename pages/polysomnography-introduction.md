# Polysomnography introduction

In-home polysomnography (PSG) was conducted using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES, Unicorder, Advanced Brain Imaging, Carlsbad CA).  Nocturnal recordings were transmitted to the centralized reading center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and data were scored by trained technicians using current guidelines.

## Signal and annotation files

[Raw polysomnography data](:files_path:/polysomnography) are available for 12,088 HCHS/SOL participants. Each recording has a signal file (.EDF) and event scoring annotations (.XML).

1. **[EDF](:files_path:/polysomnography/edfs)** - Signal files in the [European Data Format](http://www.edfplus.info/) exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. **[XML (NSRR)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr)** - Annotation files processed in the [EDF Editor and Translator](https://www.sleepdata.org/community/tools/12) tool.
