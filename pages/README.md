# About the Study

The [Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)](https://www2.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/) is a multi-center epidemiologic study in Hispanic/Latino populations to determine the role of acculturation in the prevalence and development of disease, and to identify risk factors playing a protective or harmful role in Hispanics/Latinos. The study is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and six other institutes, centers, and offices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) contributed to the first phase of the project.

In October 2015, [datasets from HCHS/SOL were pulled from BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/hchssol/?q=hchs) for the purposes of replicating on the NSRR. Our intention is to provide a small portion of the overall HCHS/SOL dataset library and to post the raw physiological sleep signal files for HCHS/SOL subjects. We are working through the processing and preparation of the signal files and plan to make them available in 2016.

The full suite of HCHS/SOL datasets can be [requested and downloaded through BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/hchssol/?q=hchs).
