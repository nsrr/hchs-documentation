# Actigraphy Introduction

The Sueno Ancillary study recruited 2,252 HCHS/SOL participants to wear wrist-worn actigraphy devices ([Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips Respironics](http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/product/HC1046964/actiwatch-spectrum-activity-monitor)) between 2010 and 2013. Participants were instructed to wear the watch for a week. Records were scored by a trained technician at the Boston Sleep Reading Center.

The [documentation folder](:files_path:/documentation) contains manuals and in-depth descriptions of the actigraphy devices and scoring process used in the Sueno Ancillary study. Further, the [`hchs-sol-sueno-ancillary` dataset](:files_path:/datasets) contains summary phenotype data from the actigraphy data collection.

## Epoch-by-epoch CSV Files

[Raw, epoch-by-epoch data files](:files_path:/actigraphy) have been created for 1,887 participants with actigraphy data whose HCHS/SOL data are available for public use. Each row in one of these CSV files represents 30 seconds worth of data from the actigraphy device.
